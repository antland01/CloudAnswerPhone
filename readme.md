# Cloud Answerphone

Simple Azure function for use as an Answerphone.

## Description

This project was started as a wat to answer my UK cellphone number whilst living in Australia. I had moved the
number onto Twilio so I decided to build an Azure function that would have a request sent to it everytime my number would be called.
